As a user,
so I can see the bookmarks that I've saved,
I would like to see a list of bookmarks.

# Create DATABASE
- In order to build a database we run CREATE DATABASE routine in psql environment, called bookmark_manager.
- We build a table within bookmark_manager database, called bookmarks.
- In order to keep a record of sql routines we create a folder and sub-folder called db and migrations, respectively.

# Seeting up a Testing Environment
- We first create a database test in our case called bookmark_manager_test and then we proceed to create bookmarks table.

# User Story for point 10
As a user,
so that I can create new bookmarks,
I want to able to enter an url into a form and see it displayed with the rest of my bookmarks.

# Delete bookmarks
- Implementation/configuration of session and method_override seetings.
